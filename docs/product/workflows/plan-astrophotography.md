# Plan an astrophotography session

## Goal and boundaries

Help the photographer choose a target/time and prepare gear using darkness, Moon, target position and weather evidence. Cloud cover is not seeing or transparency. A forecast cannot promise a successful photograph.

## Conversation and tool sequence

1. Ask for a named place, date range, target or image goal, and camera/lens/support only if the user wants gear-specific learning advice. Ask before assuming host location for “near me.” If coordinates are supplied, ask for a named destination and stop before planning.
2. Resolve the place with `resolve_place`; clarify ambiguity and retain its timezone.
3. Call `get_astronomy_window`, `get_night_conditions`, and `get_target_visibility` when a target is specified. Call `plan_observing_session` with activity “astrophotography” or “deep-sky-imaging”, the resolved place ID, local timezone and requested interval.
4. Call `compare_observing_options` only for alternatives the user chose. Call `recommend_specialist_tools` for relevant framing/planning or sky-chart apps when useful.
5. For learning requests, explain one next skill at a time. Ask for camera, lens, and support before any camera-specific starting settings; do not claim that settings guarantee a result.

## Report and partial data

List darkness, Moon illumination/position, target altitude/window, and each source's cloud/wind/temperature values and valid times separately. Name missing seeing/transparency, stale/out-of-horizon forecast, or unavailable target evidence. Suggest a test frame, stable support, battery/storage, and dew preparation appropriate to the supplied gear. Link app suggestions and mark unknown pricing clearly. Never promise image quality or success.

## Historical cloud context

For a requested historical month, use `get_clear_sky_climatology` with the resolved place ID and month. The planner also includes this source when configured. Keep its reanalysis evidence separate from current forecasts. Report the actual observing-night period, supplied-grid displacement, valid/expected hourly darkness samples, mean modeled cloud fraction and threshold sample frequencies as distinct quantities. A one-year sample remains partial and cannot establish a seasonal baseline or whole-night success probability. State absent or uncovered data explicitly; do not infer coverage for another place. For a session starting before local noon, use the preceding local observing-night date to choose its month. Source attribution and caveats must remain visible.

## Planner evidence, units and place IDs

Use the named GeoNames `placeId` and timezone returned by `resolve_place` for planning, astronomy and comparisons. OSM candidate `place:v1:osm:*` IDs identify discovery features and are unsupported planner/astronomy inputs. After selecting a candidate, explicitly identify the separately resolved named GeoNames destination used for the plan. Its astronomy, weather and horizon geometry describe that destination, not the selected OSM feature. Ask for a named destination before continuing if none has been resolved; selecting a candidate alone does not establish a supported planning location. Never convert candidate or user-supplied coordinates into a planner input.

Preserve returned `evidence`, `candidateWindows`, `gaps`, `suggestions` and `timedPreparation`. Candidate windows use supported target/darkness intersections and source-indexed weather intervals where available; sparse instant samples cannot establish continuous cloud coverage. Retain rationale, weather coverage and Moon constraint. Whole-session Moon illumination does not establish Moon-above-horizon timing throughout a window. Exact target intervals remain in evidence when the bounded window display is full. Suggestions are up to three supported calculated bright targets and may be empty with a gap. Timed beginner guidance is preparation, not a promised sighting schedule.

Pass requested supported `locale` and `units` to planning/comparison tools. Summaries use those display preferences; nested provider values keep their native units, source identity, issue/valid times and aggregation intervals. Keep native evidence distinct from formatted display values and never average providers. Comparisons retain each option's availability, evidence, candidate windows and gaps; do not omit an uncovered option or describe it as clear.

## Event coverage

When meteor timing matters, retain the 2025–2026 NASA peak-calendar coverage and separate GMN radiant-model evidence from the sky-event workflow. A forecast maximum is not an activity window, rate prediction, or recurring date. Preserve unknown timing/radiants and unsupported years instead of filling those gaps.

## Optional-service failures

Preserve the returned reason when an enabled candidate, history, aurora or site-context lookup fails or is outside coverage. Describe unavailable data as unavailable; do not describe an enabled service as disabled or interpret missing evidence as clear weather, safe access or no sky activity. Continue with the remaining supported evidence and show the gap.

## Interpret evidence and answer a beginner

When a plan contains darkness, explain civil (-6 degrees), nautical (-12 degrees) and astronomical (-18 degrees) intervals as nested periods below the Sun altitude thresholds, clipped to the requested session window. They are not exclusive twilight phases. Matching intervals never establish polar night or fake/mocked ephemerides: a short evening window can already lie entirely below all three thresholds. Describe darkness during that session; do not infer the whole day's solar behavior from it.

Treat target geometry as an observing opportunity. Milky Way visibility is conditional on dark skies, clouds, Moon, transparency and a clear local horizon; above-horizon core geometry alone cannot promise a visible band or photograph. Saturn may appear to the naked eye as a point; its rings require a telescope and suitable conditions. An interval's direction is sampled at maximum altitude among the evaluated points, not a bearing for the whole window. Keep returned sample times and intervals; use a cited sky chart for changing on-site orientation.

Keep missing weather and access unknown. Distinguish an enabled provider that is unavailable from an unconfigured fixture/artifact/index and a query outside installed coverage. Unsupported seeing/transparency, a full deep-sky catalog and global coverage are separate capability/data gaps; adding workflow text does not supply them. Report the returned reason and continue with supported evidence. State local permits or restrictions only with a returned or verified official source; otherwise ask the user to confirm with the land manager. General travel preparation is advice, not evidence of local rules or safe access.

Lead with the outcome in one sentence, then at most three bullets: useful local times and timezone with the conditions for observing; the most relevant unknowns; and one practical next step or short gear checklist. Include relevant returned source links and forecast valid times. Explain a term in plain language when first used, such as astronomical darkness meaning the Sun is at least 18 degrees below the horizon. Provide more detail when requested or necessary for the user's event/safety needs; avoid dumping raw tool fields. For learning, teach one next step using supplied gear and cited guidance.
